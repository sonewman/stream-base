# Stream-base

Node streams 3 `objectMode` **only**.

Completely compatible streams. The point of this was to reduce the streams code surface area particularly for use in the browser when using browserify.

It also allows for more customisable streams, allowing for advance method overrides (more documentation on this to come).
